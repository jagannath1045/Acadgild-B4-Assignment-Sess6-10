#Task 1: 

1. Import the Titanic Dataset from the link => Titanic Data Set. 

Perform the following: 
  
  a.	Is there any difference in fares by a different class of tickets? 
  
  Note - Show a boxplot displaying the distribution of fares by class 

b.	Is there any association with Passenger class and gender? 
  
  Note - Show a stacked bar chart 

Task 2: 
  
  1. Create a box and whisker plot by class using mtcars dataset. 


Task 3: 
  
  
  1.  A recent national study showed that approximately 44.7% of college students have used Wikipedia as a source in at least one of their term papers. Let X equal the number of students in a random sample of size n = 31 who have used Wikipedia as a source. 

Perform the below functions 

a.	Find the probability that X is equal to 17 

b.	Find the probability that X is at most 13 

c.	Find the probability that X is bigger than 11. 

d.	Find the probability that X is at least 15. 

e.	Find the probability that X is between 16 and 19, inclusive 

Task 4: 
  
  1.	If Z is norm (mean = 0, sd = 1) 

Find P(Z > 2.64) 
Find P(|Z| > 1.39) 

2.	Suppose p = the proportion of students who are admitted to the graduate school of the University of California at Berkeley, and suppose that a public relation officer boasts that UCB has historically had a 40% acceptance rate for its graduate school. Consider the data stored in the table UCBAdmissions from 1973. Assuming these observations constituted a simple random sample, are they consistent with the officer?..s claim, or do they provide evidence that the acceptance rate was significantly less than 40%? Use an Î± = 0.01 significance level. 
3.	How do you test the proportions and compare against hypothetical props? 
  
  Test Hypothesis: the proportion of automatic cars is 40%.
